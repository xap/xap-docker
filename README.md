## xap-docker

This repository contains outdated XAP Docker images and should not be used by new users.

The new repository is [gigaspaces/docker](https://github.com/gigaspaces/docker) - it contains Dockerfiles for both XAP and InsightEdge.

To can also get the docker images directly from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/gigaspaces/).

If you still wish to use this legacy repo, see instructions at [readme-old.md](readme-old.md).
